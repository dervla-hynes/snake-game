# The 'Very Hungry Caterpillar' Game

## Project aim: 
Create a game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I created this game using functional programming before learning OOP. 
I learned how to handle collision events, movements and speed in vanilla JS without using canvas. I also learned how to handle event listeners from different keycodes.

## Game instructions:
1. Press spacebar to begin the game
2. Move the hungry caterpillar with the arrow keys
3. Collect as many apples as you can
4. If you hit the edge of the box, you will have to start again

Good luck!
